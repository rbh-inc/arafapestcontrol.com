            <p>Hostels and long term care facilities, bed bugs
              have been found naturally but have never been proven to biologically transmit even one human pathogen.
              Although their bite is often nearly undetectable, their saliva contains several proteins which can cause a
              progressive sensitivity to repeated bites. Some times humans who are frequently bitten by these bugs may
              develop a sensitivity 'syndrome' which can include nervousness.</p>

            <p>Rats & mice can be responsible for that spread of a range of diseases. They also contaminate millions of
              dollars worth of food stuff
              every year with their urine & faces and can damage our properity through their gnawing habits. SSC
              regularly encounters proper-
              ties where rats have gnawed through electrical and IT wiring. Not only does this crease loss in output and
              revenue, there is also a risk that this could cause fires.</p>

            <p>Termites have the ability to change from one caste type to another during their immature stages. This
              allows the colony to change the proportion ofdifferent caste members as the need arises. The two most
              common types of termites are" dry wood"and" ground or subterranean" termites. Bothtypes of termites eat
              cellulose for nutrition. Cellulose is found in wood oroducts. Bothe types of termites have the "flying
              termite" or "winged reproductive. These winged termites are new kings and queensattempting to establish a
              new colony. Ant colonies also send warmers, which have nearly the same
              appearance as termites, but may be identified
              upon closer inspection</p>

              female fly has mated she can lay several batches of
              eggs typically containing over 100 eggs each while human commonly find adult flies to be the most
              bothersome the larval habitat
              is the preferred method of pest fly suppression by removing material in which the larvae develop the life
              cycle of the fly can be broken preventing subsequent production of adult flies while chemical pesticides
              may be effective for suppressing adult fly populations in some situation they are not a substitute for
              proper sanitation and aggressive elimination of
              nuisance fly development sites
              because flies can quickly develop resistance to insecticides use them only as a last resort to obtain
              immediate control of adult flies.</p>
